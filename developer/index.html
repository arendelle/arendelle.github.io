        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>Welcome! Arendelle language - including all the back-ends, front-ends and plugins - is a two man approach. We have created several awesome native back-ends based on our special compiler technology. We have created native user interfaces, fully integrated with our back-ends, we have created several third-party apps and programs to increase the possibilities of the language and so. With all those tools, kits and documentations you can develop applications based on Arendelle, You can help us make the language more awesome. So if you're interested in making the worlds most creative language more fun you're very welcome!</p>


        <br><br>
        <h3>Back-Ends</h3>
        <p>When we were developing Arendelle, We wanted to bring the most updated experience on any platform. We wanted to use the latest technologies and unleash the full power of our systems. So we developed 3 different engines so called back-ends to reach our goals</p><br>

        <p>You can join our developer program and help us make them even more powerful or you can use them in your software to make it understand Arendelle. Our codes comes with the best possible comments you can imagine which you can simply understand and use the codes wherever you like</p>

        <br><br>
        <h3>Arendelle Kit</h3>
        <p>Arendelle Kit is a set of special tools designed to empower Arendelle Masters and Arendelle developers to work with the language in a higher level. This tools are many from the tools to generated Arendelle coded texts to the ones like folded and highlighted HTML code generator. This tools are gathered together in a collection called Arendelle Kit available to use via our developer system</p>

        <br><br>
        <h3>Developer Front-Ends</h3>
        <p>Front-ends of Arendelle are divided to two major types: General Purpose User Interfaces, Developer Interfaces. The group one is of course our official apps and desktop applications but the type two is the special interfaces designed for Arendelle Masters, we have command-line REPL systems, Swift Playground like real-time interactive environment and much more that you can use to test and debug special Arendelle codes or you can use them to deploy Arendelle on new systems and services.</p>
