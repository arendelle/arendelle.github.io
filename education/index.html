      <img src="title.png"><hr>
      <p>When it comes to education, Arendelle is surely the best language. But for educating people you need more than a language, You need an educational system and a new teaching method.</p>

      <p>We took care of all. We created the most easy language with focus on bringing creativity increasing features as well as having an awesome easy environment for it. Moreover we have created our own teaching system as a book published free and online to everyone so it can be used by everyone!</p>

      <p>Now the question is what is the missing part? It is Education System! Old fashion education which is based on forcing you to understand </p>


      <!-- What's wrong with the education system" -->
      <br><br><br><br>
      <img src="whatsWrongWithEducation.png"><hr>
      <p>To create a new better educational system, You first have to identify the problems of the previews system. Which is something very simple! The modern educational system that is being used all over the world was founded during the industrial revolution. </p>

      <p>This system was created to make people able to work in factories and companies. To do so, They had to teach people “right” and “wrong”. This right and wrong kills creativity in many different levels. Also the educational system is based on a competition to get the better job. The main reason why everyone hates educational system is that it makes people nervous. It makes people feel stress all the time.</p>

      <p>But how did people learned in the past? Was it always like this? Answer to many of us is clear and it is a big pretty “NO”. People took classes on their own, There were no tests and no stress. Because when you choose something on your own, You love it. And you go for it with no need for hateful pressures.</p>

      <br><br><br><br>
      <img src="hereComeARevolution.png"><hr>
      <p>Now the question you should ask is: “How we can fix it?”. Well Education System is wrong in all of it’s subjects. To fix it, You should replace it with a new system. In Arendelle we thought so much about the way people actually learn.</p>

      <p>Learning happens in two places: First is when you use what you learned in real life and the second is when you teach people what you learned. </p>

      <p>Fortunately in Arendelle you have to use whatever you learn, And it’s no problem. However teaching is what our new system comes. As we said before every individual must be a teacher, Also this individual must start from somewhere. We figured a simple way that solves all the problems! </p>

      <br><img src="ourModel.png"><br>

      <p>In Arendelle, When you learn it. You have to share what you learned with three more person. Using this way you “teach” others which makes what you learned stay with you for the rest of your life, By teaching people you give three more people the chance of learning, teaching and enjoying and also you share Arendelle and you help us. So it’s a win, win, win, win, win!</p>


      <!-- What To Do Now? -->
      <br><br><br><br>
      <img src="whatToDoNow.png"><hr>

      <p>If you want to join this program the process easy! We ask you to promise us to teach three person in return that they do this process again. Then you should read the <a href="http://book.arendelle.org">Arendelle Book</a> and use it’s way to teach people how to program. And after that you can be sure you have learned programming right and you have change so many lives and made them better and happier. </p>

      <p>Thank you so much for reading this and being a part of our movement!</p>
