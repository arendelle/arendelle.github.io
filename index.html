Programming is fun, it’s brilliant and it’s awesome. However the whole idea of coding is too scary for everyone and programming languages are not really beauty queens. As developers with much interest in design we have seen the beauty inside those not well looking codes so we always wanted to find a way to share the way we enjoy coding with other people and that’s why we’ve created Arendelle.<br>

Arendelle is a whole new experience of coding in a much cleaner, much simpler and a much more beautiful way. Unlike other languages with Arendelle you create 8-Bit illustrations with five colors! Just like the way it sounds Arendelle makes you a minimal and creative artist. The minimalism of the language also makes your mind clear and most of the times a much better coder.<br>

Also as we love design. It was always important for us to create a language that looks pretty. Like the way English letters are gorgeous we tried to create a language that looks magnificent in your eyes, A language easy to understand. Arendelle is by far the cleanest and the most simple language of computing world. You can’t create a simpler language than Arendelle.<br>

Moreover we wanted to make Arendelle available anywhere like air and thanks to everyone who worked on Arendelle it works on all the major desktop operating systems such as Mac, Windows and GNU/Linux also it’s available on popular iOS and Android platforms for mobile devices.<br>

Arendelle is new in every single aspect as we have removed, merged, reimagined and redesigned everything about a programming language in Arendelle, once you code in Arendelle you notice that it’s the most creative language you may ever find so we can write pages about why Arendelle is cool, About our magnificent parallel processing systems and many more but the thing you really need to know is it doesn’t matter if you’re 4 or 99 and it’s not important if you’re a pro developer or someone curious willing to learn programming, Arendelle makes you smile!
