      <img src="title.png"><hr>
      <p>Arendelle Project is a community with a mission: Maintaining and Developing the Arendelle Language and it’s sub-projects. We have created Arendelle Language and our very own education system here. We also research on possibilities of Arendelle and the areas we can move it to. This is Arendelle Project, A community of people who loves to share their love by creating their own computing world</p>

      <!-- Earth Friendly -->
      <br><br><br><br>
      <img src="earthFriendly.png"><hr>
      <p>We love our planet and that’s why we took so much care about being “Green”. We have no printed material at all. Arendelle’s Book is freely published online and also in all famous ebook formats but never printed by us. Our website’s are stored on large shared hosting services that means we use the minimum possible energy for keeping and cooling our data. We only distribute our products over web with our modular updating system in possible situations which makes us make no paper trash but also use minimum bandwidth for updating our products. So as you see we are green and we try so much to make this process even more Earth friendly </p>

      <!-- Open Source and Free Of Charge -->
      <br><br><br><br>
      <img src="openSourceAndFree.png"><hr>
      <p>All of the projects of Arendelle Project are and will be shared fully free of charge and entirely open source. We believe in Arendelle as something from heart, something made with love and as language of our community. So if Arendelle is for a community it must be open source so every be able to develop it and the whole community be involved. Also if it’s from heart with love, You can’t sell love because when you sell things there is no love in it! Love is priceless so is Arendelle. You can be sure everywhere you anytime Arendelle is freely available.</p>

      <!-- Story -->

      <img src="story.png"><hr>

      <p><small><i>A full story can be found at <a href="http://kary.us/2015/01/09/sweet-18/">Pouya Kary's Blog</a></i></small></p>

      <p>Arendelle began in a cold winter day of early 2014 when <a href="http://kary.us">Pouya Kary</a> started to write a simple code to be able to draw on his calculators screen (A simulation of that code can be found as <a href="https://github.com/arendelle/buld.arendelle">bulda.arendelle</a> written in Arendelle). </p>

      <p>After few weeks Pouya realized it’s possible to implement programming structures and features to this code so he started to write the system for his computer and he succeeded to implement the loop grammar for it, As Pouya was watching Disney’s Frozen he felt in love with the movie so much that now all of our sub-projects are named after characters of Frozen as well as our main name “Arendelle” which is the beautiful city of the movie.</p>

      <p>Months later in the summer of 2014 Pouya started to turn Arendelle into a full language with all of the features a language needed. And one month latter he had the language working as he succeeded to write his <a href="http://kary.us/projects/knight/">Knight Path Optimization</a> on Arendelle.</p>

      <p>However the design of the first compiler of Arendelle wasn’t so good and it caused problems for Pouya to create UIs for it and Arendelle reached it’s development hell.</p>

      <p>In September 21, 2104. An old coding-friend of Pouya, <a href="https://github.com/DeerMichel">Micha Hanselmann</a> sent him an email telling about his interest on testing Arendelle, After Micha came to the project he started to port Arendelle’s compiler to Java and it was an amazing job, Speed and power of his core was amazing.</p>

      <p>Micha then started Arendelle Android app and Pouya wrote a book for Arendelle then we realized we’ve created a new model of education. So we created a <a href="http://web.arendelle.org/education">plan</a> this way we could revolutionize the educational system fully by replacing every aspect of it!</p>

    <!-- Time Line -->
    </div><br><img src="timeline.png" width="100%"><br><div class="container content">

      <p>But now. Now we’re working hard to bring Arendelle to iOS and Mac and soon Windows and Web! We’re also working on some awesome ideas we may someday share like Arendelle 3D, An English like Arendelle and so much more!</p>

      <p>If you like to join this revolution and help us <a href="http://web.arendelle.org/developer/">develop</a> and <a href="http://web.arendelle.org/education/">share</a> you’re so much welcome!</p>
